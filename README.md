# radio player

radio player is an application that is designed to help me automate my radio show on KTEQ.

It chooses a playlist from the playlist directory and plays it, intermittently adding TTS song identifiers to it.

To download a new playlist, use spotdl <spotify playlist link> in the appropriate playlist directory
